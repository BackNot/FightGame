# FightGameMVC
Project is made for FUN.
It's a website where you are a fighter and your purpose is to beat other people! In order to do that you can train in the 'Training zone', 
so you can increase your strength and speed.

You can gain level when you obtain a certain amount of experience.More experience = advanced rank. (see My profile tab for more details).

When you fight someone and you win you receive money,speed,strength and exp. When you lose against someone you lose stats.
There's slight bonus for the defender. There's also bonus for stats that are closer to each other. (For example: Strength 100 with speed 0 is weaker than Strength 70 and Speed 50)

Stack used: ASP.NET MVC,ASP.NET Identity,Entity Framework, HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript(jQuery) , Bootstrap 4.

Suited for: Visual Studio 2017 && SQL Server 2017.
